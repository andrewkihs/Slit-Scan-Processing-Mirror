# Digital Mirror
This repo contains a Processing sketch with a moving slit scan. It takes pixel data from a moving column of webcam data and prints it on top of live webcam footage using a combination of PImage and PGraphics objects. After looping across the width of the camera, a new visualization starts which splays pixels across the screen. This visualization never clear()'s and is meant to generate interesting/indistinguishable patterns when left running.

# Demo
Perhaps the best way to demonstrate this code is to show you....
[Here is a link to a video of the sketch in action!](https://vimeo.com/255895240)
